          <h2>Jeopardy Project</h2>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <p>For our project, we decided that we wanted to work with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/">Jeopardy dataset</a>
          . Since we both like gameshows, we wanted to see if there were any
          interesting findings in this dataset. Our idea was to first try to datamine
          the dataset to see if there were any interesting trends. Then we wanted
          to see if we could make a model to classify the prize value of a
          question based on the question text. Finally, we wanted to make a website
          to store all of our information.</p>

          <h2>Initial Findings</h2>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <p>First we just uploaded the data into a jupyter notebook and looked
          through to see if there were any interesting patterns.</p>
