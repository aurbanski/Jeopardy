          <h2>Jeopardy Project</h2>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <p>For our project, we decided that we wanted to work with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/">Jeopardy dataset</a>
          . Since we both like gameshows, we wanted to see if there were any
          interesting findings in this dataset. Our idea was to first try to datamine
          the dataset to see if there were any interesting trends. Then we wanted
          to see if we could make a model to classify the prize value of a
          question based on the question text. Finally, we wanted to make a website
          to store all of our information.</p>

          <h2>Initial Findings</h2>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <p>
            First we just uploaded the data into a jupyter notebook and looked
            through to see if there were any interesting patterns. We initally just
            uploaded the jeopardy csv and checked out the data. There were 216,928
            entries and 7 columns.

          <h4>Insights</h4>
          <p>
            After checking out the initial format of the data, we started going into
            the data to see if we could find patterns. We checked into the answer and
            category columns to see what the most common answers and categories were.

          <h4>Answers</h4>
          <p>
            What we found was that the most common answers are China and Australia but
            all of the top 10 most common answers are geographic locations.

          <h4>Categories</h4>
          <p>
            We also found the most common categories that are used on Jeopardy. A lot of
            the most common categories were academic fields like Science, Literature,
            and American History.
